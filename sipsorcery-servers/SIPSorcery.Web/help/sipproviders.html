        SIP Provider Manager
     </h2>
     <p>
      The SIP Provider Manager is used to create, update and delete SIP Providers and any bindings (registrations) for them. It is also used to view 
      SIP Provider current bindings. There are a number of properties that apply when creating or updating a SIP Provider and these are explained below:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Id</b>: A GUID used by the system to uniquely store each SIP Provider.</li>
      <li><b>Owner</b>: The name of the username that created the SIP Provider.</li>
      <li><b>Provider Name</b>: The descriptive name used to identify the SIP Provider and that is used by the dialplan when placing 
        calls with this SIP Provider.</li>
      <li><b>Username</b>: The username for the SIP Provider, it will be used when responding to authentication challenges for calls and registrations.</li>
      <li><b>Password</b>: The password for the SIP Provider, it will be used when responding to authentication challenges for calls and registrations.</li>
      <li><b>Server</b>: The hostname or IP address for the SIP Provider. Call and register requests will be sent to this server.</li>
      <li><b>Register</b>: If checked then a SIP Provider binding entry will be created and an attempt will be made to register with the SIP Provider.
        The status of the binding attempt will be shown in the SIP Provider Registrations table.</li>
      <li><b>Register Contact</b>: If the Register box is checked a SIP URI must be specified for the Register Contact. The SIP URI will be sent to the
        SIP Provider and informs it where incoming calls should be forwarded to. If it is desired that incoming calls for the Provider should be 
        forwarded to the SIP Sorcery server then the Register Contact should be set as: username@sipsorcery.com where username is the SIP Account username
        that will receive the call.</li>
     </ul>
     
     Advanced Settings are additional settings that are not normally required but that can be used to refine the SIP Provider interaction.
     
     <ul>
       <li><b>Outbound Proxy</b>: If set overrides the SIP Provider Server setting for call requests.</li>
       <li><b>Auth Username</b>: If set overrides the SIP Provider Username setting when responding to authentication challenges.</li>
       <li><b>From Header</b>: If set overrides the default header that is set for new calls to the SIP Provider. The default From Header for a 
         SIP Provider is: username@server. Changing this setting has ramifications for authentication as most SIP Providers use the username
         portion of the From Header to identify users. An example that allows modification of display name portion of the From Header 
         and that leaves the username and server intact is: "Your Name" &lt;sip:username@server&gt;.</li>
       <li><b>Register Expiry</b>: The number of seconds to request for the binding expiry when registering with the SIP Provider. Can be between 60 and 3600.</li> 
       <li><b>Register Realm</b>: If set overrides the SIP Provider Server setting when responding to authentication challenges.</li>
       <li><b>Register Server</b>: If set overrides the SIP Provider Server setting for registration requests.</li>
       <li><b>Custom Headers</b>: An optional list of SIP headers that will be added to register and call requests made with the SIP Provider.
        Values must be entered as valid SIP headers, an example is: P-src-ip: 127.0.0.1 or User-Agent: my user agent.</li>
     </ul>
