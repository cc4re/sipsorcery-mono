        Monitor Console
         User Guide</h2>
         
     <p>
     The Console can only be used where the Silverlight browser application is able to establish a direct TCP connection back to the
     SIP Sorcery server on port 4502. This requirement will preclude most corporate networks. A quick way to tell if such a TCP conenction 
     is possible is to look at the top left corner of the application, if the text reads "Ready (auto refresh enabled)" then console connections are
     possible, if it reads only "Ready" then console connections are not possible.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     The Console feature uses a telnet connection to deliver log messages to the Silverlight browser application. Telnet transmits all information
     in cleartext and is thus insecure. If you are in a risky environment, such as a public internet cafe, it would be advisable not to use the 
     Console. The main Silverlight application operates over SSL and is secure.
     </p>
     
     <p>To use the Console follow the steps below:
      
       <li>1. Click the connect button,</li>
       <li>2. Once the username prompt appears type your username into the text box at the bottom of the screen and press enter,</li>
       <li>3. Once the password prompt appears type your password into the text box at the bottom of the screen and press enter,</li>
       <li>4. Once the password prompt appears type your password into the text box at the bottom of the screen and press enter,</li>
       <li>5. once the filter prompt appears type <span style="font-family: Courier">event *</span> to get summary log messages or 
        <span style="font-family: Courier">event full</span> to get a full SIP trace,</li>
       <li>6. Press s at anytime to stop the logging and repeat step 5.</li>
     
      </p>
     
     <p>Since the Console feature is simply a telnet connection the equivalent function can also be obtained from any telnet client using:
     <span style="font-family: Courier">telnet sipsorcery.com 4502</span>.
